### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

The following is a program to query the web for urlâ€™s pertaining to COVID-19 and it's impact on the economy. In the time allotted, I was able to build a program that scrapes data indexed in Common Crawl and queries based on url. The url needs to be configured very specifically to a website, in a later model Iâ€™d hope to change that. Given this limitation, I created an array of newspapers and ran those through a loop that calls a function that prints all the pertinent urlâ€™s. Although this program is a prototype and still limited, it still exhibits enormous power.
